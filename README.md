# MedObsMind

**AI-Driven Medical Observation & Decision-Support Platform** 🏥

An intelligent clinical support system for real-time patient monitoring, clinical reasoning assistance, and medical education - built under strict ethical governance for students, clinicians, and hospitals.

## 🎯 What MedObsMind Is

MedObsMind is an **AI-powered medical observation and clinical support system** designed to improve patient safety, enhance clinical reasoning, and support medical education. It combines real-time vitals monitoring, intelligent alerts, and evidence-based decision support to help healthcare professionals detect patient deterioration early and make informed clinical decisions.

### One-Line Identity

*"An India-trained, rule-first, safety-locked medical AI system that continuously observes ICU patients, explains clinical risks using a medical LLM, and always keeps human clinicians in full control."*

### Core Philosophy: Rule-First AI 🛡️

**MedObsMind follows a strict hierarchy:**
1. **Rules Fire First** - Clinical protocols (NEWS2, qSOFA, threshold alerts) trigger FIRST
2. **LLM Explains After** - Medical AI explains why alert fired and provides context
3. **Human Decides Always** - Clinician has final authority on all clinical decisions

**What MedObsMind Does:**
- ✅ Continuous 24/7 patient monitoring
- ✅ Transparent clinical reasoning with explanations
