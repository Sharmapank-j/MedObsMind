## 9. Example: AETCOM Case in MedObsMind

### Case Study: Resource Allocation in ICU

**AETCOM Module:** Module 3 (Advanced Clinical Scenarios)  
**NMC Competency:** Affective Domain - Medical Ethics (S level)  
**Topic:** Resource Allocation, Triage, Professional Responsibility

#### **Clinical Scenario:**

You are a second-year resident in a 10-bed ICU in a tier-2 city hospital during monsoon season. All beds are occupied. A 65-year-old diabetic patient with severe pneumonia needs ICU admission urgently. 

Current patients include:
- 28-year-old dengue shock syndrome (Day 2, improving)
- 75-year-old stroke (Day 7, stable but needs monitoring)
- 40-year-old road traffic accident (Day 1, critical)
- Others similarly occupied

The new patient's son is willing to pay for private ICU but no beds available. The dengue patient is on government scheme (Ayushman Bharat).

#### **Ethical Dilemma:**

1. Should you discharge the dengue patient (improving) to admit the new patient?
2. How do you factor in payment status (private vs. government scheme)?
3. What communication is needed with families?
4. What if the dengue patient's condition worsens after discharge?

#### **Your Decision:**

[ ] A. Discharge dengue patient (medical improvement justifies)
[ ] B. Keep dengue patient, refer new patient elsewhere
[ ] C. Consult ICU team and make shared decision
[ ] D. Prioritize based on payment capacity

#### **LLM Explanation (After Your Choice):**

**Best Practice: Option C (Shared Decision-Making)**

**Ethical Framework:**

1. **Beneficence:** Both patients need care
2. **Non-maleficence:** Early discharge risks dengue complications
3. **Justice:** Payment status should not determine care
4. **Team-Based:** Complex decisions need consensus

**AETCOM Principles:**

- **Resource Allocation:** Use clinical criteria, not payment
- **Communication:** Transparent discussion with both families
- **Professionalism:** Consult senior, document reasoning
- **Social Responsibility:** Uphold equity in healthcare access

**Clinical Reasoning:**

- Dengue patient on Day 2 improving, but high risk till Day 5
- Premature discharge risks secondary complications
- New patient severe, but not immediately life-threatening
- Can new patient be stabilized in ER temporarily?
- Is step-down unit available for dengue patient?

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Immediate:** Stabilize new patient in ER, consult senior
2. **Team Discussion:** ICU consultant, resident, nursing lead
3. **Assessment:** Re-evaluate all 10 patients' stability
4. **Communication:** Explain situation to both families honestly
5. **Decision:** Based on clinical status, not payment
6. **Documentation:** Rationale, consent, team consensus
7. **Follow-up:** Ensure continuity for any transferred patient

**Indian Context:**

- Ayushman Bharat patients have equal rights
- Government schemes should not affect clinical priority
- Resource constraints common in India, ethical framework critical
- Family involvement important, but final decision medical
- Document everything for medical-legal protection

**Further Learning:**

- NMC Ethics Guidelines: Resource Allocation
- ICMR Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research
- Triage Protocols for Indian ICUs
- Communication in Resource-Constrained Settings
